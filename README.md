# CPP Introduction:

    1. Low level Programming
    2. Speed of Execution
    3. Derived from C
    4. Richer Library than C
    5. Object Oriented Programming

# Application:

Chrome, Firefox, Most of the Operating System(s) are written in C or C++.
Adobe Products, Device Drivers.

# First CPP Program:

    ```
    #include<iostream>
    using namespace std;

    int main(){
      cout<<"Hello World"; //Insertion Operator
      return 0;
    }
    ```
# Basic I/O in CPP:

    1. cout -> std O/P stream
    2. cin -> std I/P stream
    3. cerr -> std unbuffered error stream
    4. clog -> stdbuffered I/P stream
