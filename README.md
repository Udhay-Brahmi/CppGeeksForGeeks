# CPP Introduction:

    1. Low level Programming
    2. Speed of Execution
    3. Derived from C
    4. Richer Library than C
    5. Object Oriented Programming

# Application:

1. Chrome, Firefox, Most of the Operating System(s) are written in C or C++.
2. Adobe Products, Device Drivers.

# First CPP Program:

    ```
    #include<iostream>
    using namespace std;

    int main(){
      cout<<"Hello World"; //Insertion Operator
      return 0;
    }
    ```
# Basic I/O in CPP:

    1. cout -> std O/P stream.
    2. cin -> std I/P stream.
    3. cerr -> std unbuffered error stream.
    4. clog -> std buffered I/P stream.
    5. endl -> New line => flushed the buffer while '\n' simply puts a new line.

# Errors in CPP:

    1. Syntax Errors
    2. Semantic Errors
    3. Linker Errors
    4. Runtime Errors
    5. Logical Errors

# Associativity & Precedence:

# Operator in CPP:

    1. Arithmetic Operator
    2. Relational Operator
    3. Logical Operator
    4. Assignment Operator

# Loops in CPP:

    1. To do something repeatedly.
    2. To iterate through containers like arrays, list, etc.
    3. To run something forever like wen servers or other system.

# For Loop:

Iterating through an array, list or any other containers, we generally prefer for loop.

# While Loop:

    1. Complex Logic Implementation(easily possible).
    2. Web servers.
    3. Game (Something coming Infinitely).

# Jump Statements:

    1. break
    2. continue
    3. return
    4. goto

# Functions in CPP:

1. Functions is a block of code that take I/P and gives O/P however I/O are optional.
2. Functions calls are happens in Last In First Out (LIFO) order.
3. We can use return Statement with void also in normal function which return a data type
we write something after return. But in void we can use return semi-colon to stop the
execution at that point and return.

# Application of Functions:

    1. Avoid code Redundary.
    2. Make code modular.
    3. Abstraction (for e.g. In Library functions, we do not have to worry about how they work).

# More on Functions in CPP:

    1. Inline function.
    2. Function Overloading.
    3. Default Argument.
